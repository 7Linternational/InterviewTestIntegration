#Problem

- Fork this repo
- Clone your fork locally
- Create an API integration with the following API endpoint:
  - https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/categories.php
- Fetch data and create a vertical list with specific information from each entry:
  - `Image of category` & `Category name`
- On tap/click of each list item, a second page should show with fetched results from the selected category using an API like the following:
  - https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=category_name
  - Again a vertical list must be created with each entry with the following data:
    - `Thumbnail Image` & `Meal name`
    - On tap/click of each list item a final detail page should show with the meal description and incredients.
- The whole application should be viewable and functional both on web and a mobile device.
- Commit and Push to your forked repository your final code and send us a URL with it.


Thanks and have fun!
